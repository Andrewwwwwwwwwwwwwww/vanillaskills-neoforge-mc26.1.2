 * Validate the things that silently break the CLIENT but never fail a build.
 *
 *   node tools/check-assets.js
 *
 * Two real bugs motivated this, both shipped to players unnoticed:
 *
 *   1. PLACEHOLDER TEXTURES IN THE JAR. The 2.0 art drop landed in resourcepack/ only and was never
 *      copied back into src/main/resources/. Nine items (the three shard items and six crates) kept
 *      their 155-byte magenta placeholder inside the mod. Servers looked fine — the pushed pack
 *      covers them — so it only showed in SINGLE PLAYER, where no pack is pushed and the jar is the
 *      only source of art. Every mod texture must be byte-identical to the pack's copy.
 *
 *   2. DUPLICATE LANG KEYS. A second "vanillaskills.points.tasks" was added for a new screen entry
 *      while the old one still existed. Gson parses the language file strictly, so ONE duplicate
 *      throws and the WHOLE file fails to load — every string in every language silently falls back
 *      to its hardcoded English. It logged one line and was otherwise invisible.
 *
 * Neither is a compile error, and neither is caught by check-parity.js (which compares editions
 * against each other — and a bug copied to all four editions is "in parity").
